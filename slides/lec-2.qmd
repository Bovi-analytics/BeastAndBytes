# Reproducible & FAIR data science

## What are the FAIR principles

**FAIR data** is [data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data") which meets the **FAIR principles** of [findability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability "Findability"), accessibility, [interoperability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interoperability "Interoperability"), and [reusability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability "Reusability") (FAIR).^[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data#cite_note-FAIR_principles_2016-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data#cite_note-2)^ The acronym and principles were defined in a March 2016 paper in the journal [*Scientific Data*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Data_(journal) "Scientific Data (journal)") by a consortium of scientists and organizations.^[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data#cite_note-FAIR_principles_2016-1)^

## Get to know the principles (1)

-   Get familiar with FAIR by looking at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K40utIzUzOk).

-   Read the intial [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) on *The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardschip.*

-   Explore the [vision of Cornell University on FAIR principles](https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/sharing/fair/) and their cheatsheets.

## Get to know the principles (2)

-   Check for reproducible advise in the [tutorials](https://bovi-analytics.com/tutorials/) at the bovi-analytics website.

-   Discuss with the entire team and Dr. Miel Hostens (contact him on his desk) on how this will reflect on your team project.

## Findable

The first step in (re)using data is to find them. [Metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata "Metadata") and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. [Machine-readable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine-readable_data "Machine-readable data") metadata are essential for automatic [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_discovery "Data discovery") of datasets and services, so this is an essential component of the FAIRification process.

## Findable

-   F1. (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

-   F2. Data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)

-   F3. Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

-   F4. (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

## Accessible

Once the user finds the required data, they need to know how they can be accessed, possibly including [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") and [authorisation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization "Authorization").

## Accessible

-   A1. (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

-   A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

-   A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

-   A2. Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

## Interoperable

The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for [analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis "Data analysis"), [storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_storage "Data storage"), and [processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_processing "Data processing").

## Interoperable

-   I1. (Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.

-   I2. (Meta)data use [vocabularies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_vocabulary "Controlled vocabulary") that follow FAIR principles

-   I3. (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

## Reusable

The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or combined in different settings.

## Reusable

-   R1. (Meta)data are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes

-   R1.1. (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license

-   R1.2. (Meta)data are associated with detailed provenance

-   R1.3. (Meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

# Topics

## Introduction to statistical programming (WC)

📖 Within the statistical programming labs, we will follow the [Introduction to Data Science](https://rafalab.dfci.harvard.edu/dsbook-part-1/) handbook by Rafael Irizarry.

📧 Send email with your Gmail address to me (miel.hostens\@cornell.edu) so I can give you access to Google Drive and Google Colab.

💻 You will have to install R & R-studio on your computer.

## A guideline to reproducible & FAIR data science (IC)

📺 Get familiar with FAIR by looking at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K40utIzUzOk).

📖 Read the intial [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) on *The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardschip.*

🔬 Explore the [vision of Cornell University on FAIR principles](https://data.research.cornell.edu/data-management/sharing/fair/#:~:text=The%20FAIR%20Principles%20describe%20how,and%20reuse%20of%20your%20research.) and their Fair checklist.

💻 Check for reproducible advise in the [tutorials](https://bovi-analytics.com/tutorials/) at the bovi-analytics website.

🧑🏽‍🏫 Discuss with the entire team and Dr. Miel Hostens (contact him on his desk) on how this will reflect on your team project.
